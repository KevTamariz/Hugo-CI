# Hugo-CI

In this projects i create a Hugo website, and i use a branch strategy for the workflow of this project, i create 2 branches, the main branch and the dev branch, the "dev branch" it's for developt and make changes, and we're only merge to main when the code run the build and accept the pull request
Then when we create a tag (v0.1.0) the CD it's going to run
